#Summarize the project and what problem it was solving
  There were 3 main goals in this project. The first goal was to create a function to read inputs from a file and tell the user how many times one particular item appeared in that file. The second goal was to create a function that printed out the number of times each item occured within the file. Finally, the third goal was to print out the number of times each item occured within the file with the use of a historgram.
  
  I think what I did well on this project is that I was able to get the code to run without any errors while also making sure I had correct input validation. If someone enetered anything that was not a menu option, I was able to redirect them to choosing a differen selection.
  
  I believe I could have figured out a way to make the map private. I also believe I could have figured out a way to condense my functions as they all read in lines from the same file. I am unsure how exactly I could have done this, but I believe I could have done a better job in this area. I also could have done a better job naming my files. I left a file as just a source file instead of being more specific with the name.
  
  The biggest struggle for me was writing the second function. The first function was very similar to a problem that we saw in zybooks, so it was easy to follow that code to get the desired result. I was having a really hard time trying to figure out how to get everything in the map properly. The biggest help to me was the SNHU discord. There were a lot of really helpful individuals who took their time to help me and I greatly appreciated it. I will continue to use this discord throughout my journey with this degree.
  
  I think using an OOP for this project will be the most transferable skill. I have always struggled with classes, private and public variables, and using onjects in general. This class helped me understand how to use OOP by forcing me to create a class with the proper variables and using objects.
  
  I beleive this program is maintainable because I seperated it into 3 seperate files that all have their own purpose. The basic outline is in my header file. Most of the coding is done in my source file. The most basic and easy to read pieces are in my main file. I believe it is readable because I structured my main file to be simple and concise as to what the programs goal is. It is easy to see where I want to call each function, and to see what each function does. I believe this program is adaptable because there is always more you can add on to make it better. You can always add more menu options for different ways of displaying the data.
